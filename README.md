# Tarun

## What is this?

My friend Tarun has a fun name to say. I decided to make a synthesizer that lets you play his name. You can play with the on-screen keyboard using your keys or your mouse, or you can connect a MIDI keyboard to your computer!

Sorry about the weird keyboard layout - I recorded my original "tarun" as an A, and I could only really fit an octave on the screen.
